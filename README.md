# Data-Structures
This repository contains the solutions for various tasks completed during a course on "Data Structures and Algorithms". The emphasis of the course is on optimizing speed and gaining a understanding of fundamental data structures, rather than on writing easily readable code. The problems can be found in the README files or in the code itself.
